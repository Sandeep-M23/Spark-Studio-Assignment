# Sparks Studio Assignment
An Task of using Figma Design to develop an Course Card Filter Section using Reactjs for [Spark Studio](https://sparkstudio.co/).

## Objective

- You are required to build the component seen in the figma sheet shared below. 

- A demo link has been provided that has a video that demonstrates the components behaviour as well as a json file that has the data youâ€™ll need to render the component..

- The json has three key-value pairs of data, each one of them, a variant of the other.
- You are to randomly select the component data from the json on render and use accordingly.
- The data is an array of objects that contains the different variants of the selected course.
- You are to categorise the course based on Junior/Senior which is defined as two age groups, the lower min_age to max_age  being Junior, and the higher, Senior.
- Things to note :-
  - The selected sample data has a category field.
  - This category field is used in conjunction with the colour codes provided below to dynamically set the colour theme for each card.
  - You can make use of material ui or whatnot for radio buttons etc.
